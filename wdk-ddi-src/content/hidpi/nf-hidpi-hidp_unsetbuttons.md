# HidP_UnsetButtons macro

## -description

The **HidP_UnsetButtons** macro is a mnemonic alias for the [**HidP_UnsetUsages**](./nf-hidpi-hidp_unsetusages.md) function.

## -syntax

```cpp
#define HidP_UnsetButtons(Rty, Up, Lco, ULi, ULe, Ppd, Rep, Rle) \
        HidP_UnsetUsages(Rty, Up, Lco, ULi, ULe, Ppd, Rep, Rle)
```

## -parameters

### -param Rty [in]

Specifies a [**HIDP_REPORT_TYPE**](./ne-hidpi-_hidp_report_type.md) enumerator value that indicates the type of report located at *Rep*.

### -param Up [in]

Specifies the usage page of the usages specified by *ULi*.

### -param Lco [in, optional]

Specifies the [link collection](/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/link-collections) that contains the usages. If *Lco* is nonzero, the routine only sets the usages, if they exist, in this link collection. If *Lco* is zero, the routine sets the first usage for each usage it finds in the [top-level collection](/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/top-level-collections) associated with *Ppd*.

### -param ULi [in, out]

Pointer to the array of usages to set to OFF.

### -param ULe [in, out]

Specifies, on input, the number of usages in *ULi*. See the Remarks section for information about the output value.

### -param Ppd [in]

Pointer to the [pre-parsed data](/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/preparsed-data) of the top-level collection associated with the report located at *Rep*.

### -param Rep [in]

Pointer to a report.

### -param Rle [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the report located at *Rep*, which must be equal to the report length for the specified report type that [**HidP_GetCaps**](./nf-hidpi-hidp_getcaps.md) returns in a collection's [**HIDP_CAPS**](./ns-hidpi-_hidp_caps.md) structure.

## -remarks

See [**HidP_UnsetUsages**](./nf-hidpi-hidp_unsetusages.md) for return value details.
