## -description

The **HalFreeHardwareCounters** routine frees a set of hardware performance counter resources that was acquired in a previous call to [**HalAllocateHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md) routine.

## -parameters

### -param CounterSetHandle [in]

A handle to the allocated counter resources. The caller acquired this handle in a previous call to [**HalAllocateHardwareCounters**](nf-ntddk-halallocatehardwarecounters.md).

## -returns

**HalFreeHardwareCounters** returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Possible error return values include the following:

| Return code | Description |
|--|--|
| **STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER** | Parameter *CounterSetHandle* is not a valid counter resources handle. |

## -syntax

```cpp
NTSTATUS HalFreeHardwareCounters(
  _In_Â HANDLE CounterSetHandle
);
```

## -remarks

Before calling this function, the client driver is expected to stop and clear the associated counter resources.

## -see-also
