## -description

The **AcxStreamAddConnections** function adds explicit connections to a new ACX stream during [EvtAcxCircuitCreateStream](..\acxcircuit\nc-acxcircuit-evt_acx_circuit_create_stream.md)

## -parameters

### -param Stream

An existing ACXSTREAM stream object. For more information, see [ACX - Summary of ACX Objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/acx-summary-of-objects).

### -param Connections

An [ACX_CONNECTION structure](..\acxpin\ns-acxpin-acx_connection.md) that contains information about the connections to add the stream.

### -param ConnectionsCount

The number of connections that are in the stream. This is a 1 based count. 

## -returns

Returns `STATUS_SUCCESS` if the call was successful. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code. For more information, see [Using NTSTATUS Values](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-ntstatus-values).

## -remarks

If the driver does not call AcxStreamAddConnections during EvtAcxCircuitCreateStream, the ACX framework will automatically assign connections between any ACXELEMENT objects that were added to the ACXSTREAM.

### Example

Example usage is shown below.

```cpp
    //
    // Explicitly connect the elements of the stream. Note that the driver doesn't 
    // need to perform this step when elements are connected in the same order
    // as they were added to the stream.
    //

    const int numElements = 2;
    const int numConnections = numElements + 1;

    ACXSTREAM                      Stream;

    ACX_CONNECTION connections[numConnections];
    ACX_CONNECTION_INIT(&connections[0], Stream, Elements[ElementCount - 2]);
    ACX_CONNECTION_INIT(&connections[1], Elements[ElementCount - 2], Elements[ElementCount - 1]);
    ACX_CONNECTION_INIT(&connections[2], Elements[ElementCount - 1], Stream);

    //
    // Add the connections linking stream to elements.
    //
    status = AcxStreamAddConnections(Stream, connections, SIZEOF_ARRAY(connections));
```
