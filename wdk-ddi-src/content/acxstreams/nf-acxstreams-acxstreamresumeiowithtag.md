## -description

The **AcxStreamResumeIoWithTag** function is used to resume IO for a stream after stream IO has been stopped. It is similar to [AcxStreamResumeIo](nf-acxstreams-acxstreamresumeio.md) function, but provides the ability to use a Tag that provides additional diagnostic information.

## -parameters

### -param Stream

An existing ACXSTREAM Object. For more information, see [ACX - Summary of ACX Objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/acx-summary-of-objects).

### -param Tag

An optional Tag that is a driver-defined value that the framework includes with diagnostic tracing.

## -returns

Void

## -remarks

### Example

Example usage is shown below.

```cpp

    //
    // Resume stream IO after it was stopped with AcxStreamStopIoWithTag.
    //
    status = AcxStreamResumeIoWithTag(stream, (PVOID)this);

```

### ACX requirements
