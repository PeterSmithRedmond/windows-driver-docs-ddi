## -description

The **WWAN_NR_SERVING_CELLS_INFO** structure represents information about NR serving cells.

## -struct-fields

### -field ProviderIdOffset

The offset in bytes, calculated from the beginning of this structure, to a numeric (0-9) string called *ProviderId* that represents the network provider identity. This string is a concatenation of a three-digit Mobile Country Code (MCC) and a two or three-digit Mobile Network Code (MNC). This member can be NULL when no *ProviderId* information is returned.

### -field ProviderIdSize

The size, in bytes, used for *ProviderId*.

### -field NCI

The NR Cell Identity is a 36-bit identity having a value range of 0 to 68719476736. An NR Cell Global Identity (NCGI) can be constructed from *ProviderId* and **NCI**. Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

### -field PhysicalCellID

The physical Cell ID (0-1007). Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

### -field NRARFCN

The Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number of the serving cells. The range is 0 to 3279165. Use 0xffffffff when the information is not available.

### -field TAC

The Tracking Area Code (TAC) is a 24-bit value range (0 to 16777215). It is used to identify the tracking area within the scope of a public land mobile network (PLMN). Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available. 

### -field RSRP

The average Reference Signal Received Power. The range is 0 to 127 and mapped to -156 to -31 dBm. Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

### -field RSRQ

The average Reference Signal Received Quality. The range is 0 to 127 and mapped to -43 to 20 dB. Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

### -field SINR

The average Reference Signal to Noise and Interference Ratio. The range is 0 to 127 and mapped to -23 to 40 dB. Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

### -field TimingAdvance

The timing advance value in microseconds, where the formula is defined in section 7.2 in [5G; NR; Requirements for support of radio resource management](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/138100_138199/138133/15.06.00_60/ts_138133v150600p.pdf). Use 0xFFFFFFFF when this information is not available.

### -field Data

The data buffer containing the *ProviderId*.
