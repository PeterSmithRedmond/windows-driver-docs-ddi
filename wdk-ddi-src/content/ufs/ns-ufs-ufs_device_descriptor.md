- When the device receives QUERY REQUEST UPIU to clear the **fBackgroundOpsEn** Flag. The device is expected to terminate background operations within the latency limit.

### -field bInitActiveICCLevel

### -field wSpecVersion[2]

Indicates the specification version in binary coded decimal (BCD) format.

### -field wManufactureDate[2]

Specifies the manufacturing date in BCD format as 0xMMYY.

### -field iManufacturerName

### -field bWriteBoosterBufferPreserveUserSpaceEn

Setting **bWriteBoosterBufferPreserveUserSpaceEn** to 0x01 avoids the reduction of the total user space that can be configured during provisioning, but might result in lower performance. If **bWriteBoosterBufferPreserveUserSpaceEn** is set to 0x00, the write booster buffer reduces the total user space that can be configured during provisioning.

### -field bWriteBoosterBufferType

**bWriteBoosterBufferType** configures the the write booster buffer type. A value of 0x00 specifies logical unit dedicated buffer mode. A value of 0x01 specifies shared buffer mode.

**dNumSharedWriteBoosterBufferAllocUnits** specifies the write booster buffer size for a shared write booster buffer configuration.

## -remarks

If **bBootEnable** in the **UFS_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR** is set to zero or if the *Boot Well Known Logical Unit* is not mapped to an enabled logical unit, then the *Boot Well Known Logical Unit* shall terminate.

**UFS_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR** is read only, some of its parameters may be changed by changing the corresponding parameter in **[UFS_UNIT_CONFIG_DESCRIPTOR](ns-ufs-ufs_unit_config_descriptor.md)**.
