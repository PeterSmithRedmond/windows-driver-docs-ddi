## -description

**D3DDDI_NATIVEFENCEMAPPING** contains native GPU fence address mappings in the caller's process address space.

## -struct-fields

### -field CurrentValueCpuVa

Read-only mapping of the current value for the CPU. This value is used by user-mode components to poll the native fence [**CurrentValue**](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects).

### -field CurrentValueGpuVa

Read/write mapping of the current value for the GPU in the current process's address space. This value is used by the GPU engine to read or write to the native fence **CurrentValue** as a fence signal operation.

### -field MonitoredValueGpuVa

Read/write mapping of the monitored value for the GPU in the current process's address space. This value is used by the GPU engine to check whether a conditional CPU interrupt should be raised.

### -field Reserved[32]

Reserved for system use.

## -remarks

For more information about native GPU fences, see [Native GPU fence objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects).
