## -remarks

A WDDM feature is identified by a [feature ID](ne-d3dukmdt-dxgk_feature_id.md) value that has a [feature category](ne-d3dukmdt-dxgk_feature_category.md) (upper 4 bits) and a sub-ID (bottom 28 bits). The feature sub-ID is one of the values in this enumeration when the feature category is **DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER**.

For more information, see [Querying WDDM feature support and enablement](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/querying-wddm-feature-support-and-enablement).
