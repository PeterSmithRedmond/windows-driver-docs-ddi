## -description

The **DXGK_NATIVE_FENCE_LOG_HEADER** structure contains the header information for the native fence log buffer.

## -struct-fields

### -field FirstFreeEntryIndex

Index of the first free entry in the log. **FirstFreeEntryIndex** is the same value as the LowPart of **AtomicWraparoundAndEntryIndex**.

### -field WraparoundCount

The number of times the log entries have wrapped around. Same value as the HighPart of **AtomicWraparoundAndEntryIndex**.

### -field AtomicWraparoundAndEntryIndex

A 64-bit integer that contains the **FirstFreeEntryIndex** in the LowPart and the **WraparoundCount** in the HighPart.

### -field Type

A [**DXGK_NATIVE_FENCE_LOG_TYPE**](ne-d3dukmdt-dxgk_native_fence_log_type.md) enumeration that specifies the type of the native fence log entries.

### -field NumberOfEntries

Number of [**DXGK_NATIVE_FENCE_LOG_ENTRY**](ns-d3dukmdt-dxgk_native_fence_log_entry.md) structures in the **Entries** array of the [native fence log buffer](ns-d3dukmdt-dxgk_native_fence_log_buffer.md).

### -field Reserved[2]

Reserved for system use.

## -remarks
