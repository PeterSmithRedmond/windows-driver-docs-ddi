# D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS structure

## -description

The **D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS** structure describes how to create a context in a call to the [**pfnCreateContextCb**](/previous-versions/ff568895(v=vs.85)) function.

## -struct-fields

### -field NullRendering

Specifies whether the GPU should process any commands that are sent by the context that is created. The **NullRendering** bit-field flag is set to inform the GPU not to process any commands that are sent by the context. The **NullRendering** bit-field flag is set only during performance investigating and debugging to simulate an infinitely fast rendering engine that still must perform the overhead of DMA buffer submission and signaling. **NullRendering** is never set during typical operations.

### -field InitialData

When set, indicates that the context is created with initial data.

### -field DisableGpuTimeout

When set, indicates that the GPU timeout is disabled for the context.

### -field SynchronizationOnly

When set, indicates that the context is created for synchronization purposes only, and not for rendering.

### -field HwQueueSupported

When set, indicates that the context supports hardware queues, which can improve efficiency in command processing.

### -field NoKmdAccess

When set, indicates that the context is created without kernel-mode driver (KMD) access. Added in WDDM 2.3.

### -field TestContext

When set, indicates that the context is created for testing purposes. Added in WDDM 2.3.

### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.

### -field Value

A member in the union that is contained in D3DDDI_CREATECONTEXTFLAGS that can hold one 32-bit value that identifies how to create the context.
