## -description

A **DXGK_FEATURE_ID** enumeration value identifies a WDDM feature.

## -enum-fields

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_HWSCH

The hardware accelerated GPU scheduling feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_HWFLIPQUEUE

The [hardware flip queue](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/hardware-flip-queue) feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_LDA_GPUPV

The linked display adapter in GPU paravirtualization feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_KMD_SIGNAL_CPU_EVENT

The [signaling of a CPU event by KMD](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/signaling-cpu-event-from-kmd) feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_USER_MODE_SUBMISSION

The user-mode submission feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_SHARE_BACKING_STORE_WITH_KMD

The [allowing UMD to share the backing store with KMD](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/sharing-backing-store-with-kmd) feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_SAMPLE

Drivers can use this value to test their implementations.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_PAGE_BASED_MEMORY_MANAGER

The page-based memory management feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_KERNEL_MODE_TESTING

The kernel-mode testing interface feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_64K_PT_DEMOTION_FIX

The OS's 64k page table demotion fix "feature", which indicates that the OS has the fix for 64K page table demotion enabled. 64KB page table demotion happens when a GPU VA range mapped by 64KB pages needs to be partially mapped by 4KB pages. In this case the page table with 64KB entries is converted (demoted) to a page table with 4KB entries. The bug was that the driver protection and allocation handle wasn't preserved during the demotion. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER. See Remarks for more information.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_GPUPV_PRESENT_HWQUEUE

The OS has the fix for the issue in GPU paravirtualization and hardware scheduling enabled. If a DXGK context object had multiple hardware queues and [**D3DKMTPresent**](../d3dkmthk/ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_present.md) was called with a hardware queue that wasn't first in the list of queues, the very first hardware queue was used on the host to handle the Present. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER. See Remarks for more information.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_NATIVE_FENCE

The native GPU fence feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

### -field DXGK_FEATURE_GPUVAIOMMU

The GPU virtual address with IoMmu feature. The feature category is DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY_DRIVER.

## -remarks

A WDDM feature is identified by its feature ID (**DXGK_FEATURE_ID**) which is composed of:

* A [**DXGK_FEATURE_CATEGORY**](ne-d3dukmdt-dxgk_feature_category.md) value that identifies the feature's category ID. This information is stored in the upper four bits of **DXGK_FEATURE_ID**.
* A [**DXGK_DRIVER_FEATURE**](ne-d3dukmdt-dxgk_driver_feature.md) value that identifies the feature itself.

Because the original feature implementations didn't categorize the feature IDs, there are a handful of feature IDs that must remain defined within category 0 for backwards compatibility, but are not driver features. This applies to the following feature IDs:

* DXGK_FEATURE_64K_PT_DEMOTION_FIX
* DXGK_FEATURE_GPUPV_PRESENT_HWQUEUE
* All feature IDs in the range of DXGK_DRIVER_FEATURE_RESERVED_1 through DXGK_DRIVER_FEATURE_RESERVED_25

These feature IDs represent features that have been defined or implemented on older OS builds, and existing software checks must be able to continue to query these features by those IDs. Drivers aren't required to implement support for any of these feature IDs.

For more information, see [Querying WDDM feature support and enablement](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/querying-wddm-feature-support-and-enablement).
