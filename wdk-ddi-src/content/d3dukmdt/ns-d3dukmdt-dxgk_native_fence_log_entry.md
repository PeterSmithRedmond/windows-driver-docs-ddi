## -description

The **DXGK_NATIVE_FENCE_LOG_ENTRY** structure contains a native fence log entry.

## -struct-fields

### -field FenceValue

UMD payload: The newly signaled/unblocked fence value.

### -field hNativeFence

UMD payload: User-mode D3DKMT_HANDLE of the native fence to which this operation belongs.

### -field OperationType

UMD payload: A [**DXGK_FENCE_LOG_OPERATION**](ne-d3dukmdt-dxgk_native_fence_log_operation.md) value that specifies the type of the operation.

### -field Reserved0

Reserved for alignment.

### -field FenceObservedGpuTimestamp

GPU Payload: When **OperationType** is OPERATION_WAIT_UNBLOCKED, specifies the GPU time at which an unresolved wait command was seen by the engine and stalled the HWQueue.

### -field Reserved1

Reserved for alignment.

### -field FenceEndGpuTimestamp

GPU Payload: GPU time at which the fence operation completed on the GPU.
