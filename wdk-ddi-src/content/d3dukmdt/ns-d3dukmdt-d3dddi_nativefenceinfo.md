## -description

**D3DDDI_NATIVEFENCEINFO** describes the attributes of a native fence synchronization object.

## -struct-fields

### -field InitialFenceValue

[in] The initial fence value.

### -field EngineAffinity

[in] Defines the physical adapters where the GPU virtual address is mapped.

### -field Type

[in] A [**D3DDDI_NATIVEFENCE_TYPE**](ne-d3dukmdt-d3dddi_nativefence_type.md) value that specifies the type of the fence.

### -field Flags

[in] A [**D3DDDI_SYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT_FLAGS**](ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_synchronizationobject_flags.md) structure that identifies the attributes of the synchronization object.

### -field NativeFenceMapping

[out] A [**D3DDDI_NATIVEFENCE_MAPPING**](ns-d3dukmdt-d3dddi_nativefencemapping.md) structure in which the process mapping information for the native fence is returned.

### -field Reserved[32]

Reserved for system use.

## -remarks
