## -description

The **D3DDDI_DOORBELLSTATUS** enumeration indicates the status of a doorbell object.

## -enum-fields

### -field D3DDDI_DOORBELLSTATUS_CONNECTED

Indicates that the doorbell object is successfully connected to a hardware queue and ready for work submission.

### -field D3DDDI_DOORBELLSTATUS_CONNECTED_NOTIFY_KMD

Indicates that the doorbell object is connected; however, after every new work submission and doorbell ring, UMD should notify KMD by calling [**D3DKMTNotifyWorkSubmission**](../d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtnotifyworksubmission.md).

### -field D3DDDI_DOORBELLSTATUS_DISCONNECTED_RETRY

Indicates that the doorbell can't be connected at this time, but UMD should retry to connect it.

### -field D3DDDI_DOORBELLSTATUS_DISCONNECTED_ABORT

Indicates that the doorbell won't be connected and UMD can't use this hardware queue for work submission. This failure typically implies a nonrecoverable scenario such as a GPU reset or stopped adapter.
