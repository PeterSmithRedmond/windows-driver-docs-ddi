## -description

The **NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES** structure specifies a network adapter's receive filtering capabilities.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

The size of this structure in bytes.

### -field SupportedPacketFilters

A [**NET_PACKET_FILTER_FLAGS**](ne-netadapter-net_packet_filter_flags.md) enumeration. These flags describe the receive packet filters that the network adapter supports.

### -field MaximumMulticastAddresses

The maximum number of addresses that the multicast address list can contain.

### -field EvtSetReceiveFilter

A pointer to the client driver's implementation of the [*EVT_NET_ADAPTER_SET_RECEIVE_FILTER*](nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_set_receive_filter.md) callback function.

## -remarks

Call [**NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES_INIT**](nf-netadapter-net_adapter_receive_filter_capabilities_init.md) to initialize this structure. The driver passes the initialized **NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES** structure as a parameter to [**NetAdapterSetReceiveFilterCapabilities**](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetreceivefiltercapabilities.md) to register it.
