## -description

The client driver implements the *EvtNetAdapterSetReceiveFilter* callback function to set changes in a network adapter's active receive filtering capabilities.

## -parameters

### -param Adapter [_In_]

A handle to a NETADAPTER object the client driver previously created with a call to [**NetAdapterCreate**](nf-netadapter-netadaptercreate.md).

### -param unnamedParam2 [_In_]

A handle to a NETRECEIVEFILTER object.

## -remarks

Register your implementation of this callback function by setting the appropriate parameter when calling [**NetAdapterSetReceiveFilterCapabilities**](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetreceivefiltercapabilities.md).
