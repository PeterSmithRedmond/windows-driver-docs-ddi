## -description

The **NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES_INIT** function initializes a [**NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netadapter-net_adapter_receive_filter_capabilities.md) structure. 

## -parameters

### -param Capabilities [_Out_]

A pointer to a driver-allocated [**NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netadapter-net_adapter_receive_filter_capabilities.md) structure.

### -param EvtSetReceiveFilter [_In_]

A pointer to the client driver's implementation of the [*EVT_NET_ADAPTER_SET_RECEIVE_FILTER*](nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_set_receive_filter.md) callback function.

## -remarks

The client driver calls **NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES_INIT** to initialize a [**NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES**](ns-netadapter-net_adapter_receive_filter_capabilities.md) structure. The driver passes the initialized **NET_ADAPTER_RECEIVE_FILTER_CAPABILITIES** structure as a parameter to the [**NetAdapterSetReceiveFilterCapabilities**](nf-netadapter-netadaptersetreceivefiltercapabilities.md) function to register it.
