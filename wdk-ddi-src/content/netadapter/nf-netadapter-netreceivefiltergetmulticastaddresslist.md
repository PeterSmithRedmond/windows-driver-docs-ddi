## -description

The **NetReceiveFilterGetMulticastAddressList** function retrieves a network adapter's multicast address list.

## -parameters

### -param ReceiveFilter [_In_]

A handle to a NETRECEIVEFILTER object.

## -returns

Returns a pointer to the first **NET_ADAPTER_LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS** structure in the network adapter's multicast address list.

## -remarks

Client drivers typically call this function during their [*EvtNetAdapterSetReceiveFilter*](nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_set_receive_filter.md) callback to get an updated multicast address list that the NIC must enable.
