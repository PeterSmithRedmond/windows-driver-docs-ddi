## -description

The **NetReceiveFilterGetPacketFilter** function retrieves the **NET_PACKET_FILTER_FLAGS**. These flags describe the packet filters that the network adapter supports.

## -parameters

### -param ReceiveFilter [_In_]

A handle to a NETRECEIVEFILTER object.

## -returns

Returns a [**NET_PACKET_FILTER_FLAGS**](ne-netadapter-net_packet_filter_flags.md) enumeration.

## -remarks

Client drivers typically call **NetReceiveFilterGetPacketFilter** during their [*EvtNetAdapterSetReceiveFilter*](nc-netadapter-evt_net_adapter_set_receive_filter.md) callback to get an updated set of [**NET_PACKET_FILTER_FLAGS**](ne-netadapter-net_packet_filter_flags.md) that the NIC must filter.
