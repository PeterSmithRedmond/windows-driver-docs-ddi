# NetAdapterCreate function


## -description

Creates a NETADAPTER object.

## -parameters

### -param AdapterInit [_In_]

A pointer to a **NETADAPTER_INIT** structure that the client driver previously received from a call to [**NetAdapterInitAllocate**](nf-netadapter-netadapterinitallocate.md).

### -param AdapterAttributes [_In_opt_]

A pointer to a caller-allocated [**WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES**](../wdfobject/ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes.md) structure. The structureâ€™s **ParentObject** must be **NULL**. The parameter is optional and can be WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES.

### -param Adapter [_Out_]

A pointer to a location that receives a handle to the new NETADAPTER object.

## -returns

The function returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this function may return an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.

## -remarks

After it has called [**WdfDeviceCreate**](../wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md), the client typically calls **NetAdapterCreate** from within its [*EvtDriverDeviceAdd*](../wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add.md) routine.

For a code example of creating a NETADAPTER, see [Device initialization](/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/device-initialization).

The NETADAPTER object is a standard WDF object. The framework manages its deletion, which occurs when the parent WDFDEVICE is deleted.
