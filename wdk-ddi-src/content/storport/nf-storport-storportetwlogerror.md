# StorPortEtwLogError function

## -description

**StorPortEtwLogError** logs an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) event for a hardware protocol error.

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

A pointer to the miniport's device extension.

### -param Address [in, optional]

The storage unit device address. This parameter is NULL for adapter devices.

### -param Id [in]

A miniport-defined event ID that uniquely identifies the event.

### -param Description [in]

The description text for the error. This parameter is required.

### -param DataBufferLength [in]

Size of *DataBuffer*, in bytes.

### -param DataBuffer [in]

A variable-size buffer that contains driver-specific binary data that is useful in identifying the cause of the error. Drivers must specify the size of this buffer in the *DataBufferLength* parameter.

## -returns

This function returns one of the following status codes.

| Return code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| STOR_STATUS_SUCCESS | The event was successfully logged. |
| STOR_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | *Description* or *DataBuffer* are NULL, or *DataBufferLength* is not greater than zero. |
| STOR_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL | StorPort was unable to log the ETW event for other reasons, such as ETW logging is not enabled. |
