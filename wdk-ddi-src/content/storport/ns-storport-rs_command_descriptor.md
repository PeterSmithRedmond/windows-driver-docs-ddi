### -field ServiceAction[2]

Provides qualification for the *OperationCode* field for some commands, allowing:

- Unrelated commands that share the same operation code, such as the Report Supported Operation Codes and the Report Target Port Groups commands.
- A set of related functions that share the same operation code, for example, the Persistent Reserve In command.

### -field Reserved1

### -field ServiceActionValid

Indicates that the contents of the *OperationCode* and *ServiceAction* fields are valid.

### -field CommandTimeoutsDescriptorPresent

Indicates that the command timeouts descriptor is included in this command descriptor.

### -field CommandDurationLimitPage

The *ReadWriteCommandDurationLimitsPage* and the *CommandDurationLimitPage* fields together indicate the mode page that specifies the command duration limit for the command.

### -field MultipleLogicalUnits

The *MultipleLogicalUnits* field is described in the following table.

| Value | Description |
|--|--|
| 0 | The effect of this command on other logical units is not reported. |
| 1 | This command only affects this logical unit. |
| 2 | This command affects more than one but not all logical units contained in this target device. |
| 3 | This command affects all of the logical units contained in this target device. |

### -field ReadWriteCommandDurationLimitsPage

The *ReadWriteCommandDurationLimitsPage* and the *CommandDurationLimitPage* fields together indicate the mode page that specifies the command duration limit for the command.

### -field Reserved2

Reserved for internal use.

### -field CdbLength[2]

Indicates the length of the command descriptor block in bytes for the *OperationCode*, and if the *ServiceActionValid* is **TRUE**, the action indicated by the *ServiceAction* field.
