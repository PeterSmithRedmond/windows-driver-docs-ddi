# StorPortSetFeatureList function

## -description

**StorPortSetFeatureList** sets the *StorPort* features that a miniport supports.

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension

Pointer to the miniport's device extension.

### -param FeatureCount

Number of features that *FeatureList* points to.

### -param FeatureList

Pointer to an array of [**STORPORT_FEATURE_TYPE**](ne-storport-storport_feature_type.md) enum values that identify the *StorPort* features supported by the miniport.

## -returns

**StorPortSetFeatureList** returns a status code such as one of the following:

| Return code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| STOR_STATUS_SUCCESS | The feature list was set successfully. |
| STOR_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | An input parameter is invalid; for example, *FeatureList* is NULL or *FeatureCount* is out of range. |
| STOR_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL | The operation failed. |

## -remarks

A miniport calls **StorPortSetFeatureList** to set the *StorPort* features that it supports. A miniport should call this function for each adapter in the beginning of its [*HwFindAdapter*](./nc-storport-hw_initialize.md) routine.
