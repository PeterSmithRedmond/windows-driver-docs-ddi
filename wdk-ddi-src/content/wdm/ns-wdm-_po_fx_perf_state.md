## -description

The **PO_FX_PERF_STATE** structure represents a performance state for a single component within a device.

## -struct-fields

### -field Value

The value of this performance state. The units are specified by the **Unit** member of the [**PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET**](./ns-wdm-_po_fx_component_perf_set.md) that contains this performance state. For example, if **Value** is 100000000 and the **Unit** member of the  **PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET** is **PoFxPerfStateUnitFrequency**, this performance state represents 100 MHz.

### -field Context

A pointer to additional context for the performance state that cannot be presented by the **Value** member. This data can be shared between the driver and the platform extension plug-in (PEP).

Using the **Context** member can hinder the visualization of performance states in Windows Performance Analyzer.

## -remarks

The **States** member of the [**PO_FX_COMPONENT_PERF_SET**](./ns-wdm-_po_fx_component_perf_set.md) structure contains an array of **PO_FX_PERF_STATE** elements.
