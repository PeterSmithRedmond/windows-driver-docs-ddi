## -description

The **ExReleaseSpinLockExclusiveFromDpcLevel** routine releases a [spin lock](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks) that the caller acquired for exclusive access, and leaves the IRQL unchanged.

## -parameters

### -param SpinLock

[in, out] A pointer to the spin lock to release. The caller must own this spin lock for exclusive access.

## -remarks

On entry to this routine, the caller must be running at IRQL \>= DISPATCH\_LEVEL. This routine does not change the IRQL.

**ExReleaseSpinLockExclusiveFromDpcLevel** releases a spin lock that the caller acquired in a previous call to the [**ExAcquireSpinLockExclusiveAtDpcLevel**](nf-wdm-exacquirespinlockexclusiveatdpclevel.md) routine.

The caller should hold the spin lock only briefly before releasing it. For more information, see [Introduction to Spin Locks](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks).
