## -description

The *DmaCompletionRoutine* callback routine notifies the driver that previously requested a system DMA transfer that this transfer is complete.

## -parameters

### -param DmaAdapter [in]

A pointer to a [DMA_ADAPTER](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_dma_adapter) structure. This structure is the adapter object that represents the driver's system DMA channel.

### -param DeviceObject [in]

A pointer to a [DEVICE_OBJECT](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_device_object) structure. This structure is the physical device object (PDO) that represents the target device for the requested DMA operation.

### -param CompletionContext [in]

A pointer to a driver-determined context for the *DmaCompletionRoutine* routine. This context is the *CompletionContext* parameter value that the driver previously passed to the [MapTransferEx](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-pmap_transfer_ex) call that initiated the system DMA transfer.

### -param Status [in]

The completion status of the DMA transfer. This parameter is a [DMA_COMPLETION_STATUS](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ne-wdm-dma_completion_status) enumeration value that indicates whether the DMA transfer completed successfully.

## -remarks

As an option, a driver can implement a *DmaCompletionRoutine* routine. When the driver requests a system DMA transfer, the driver can supply a pointer to this routine with the request. After the DMA transfer completes, the *DmaCompletionRoutine* routine is automatically called to notify the driver.

A driver's *DmaCompletionRoutine* routine is called only if the DMA transfer requested by the driver uses a system DMA controller that can generate an interrupt after a DMA transfer completes. A driver that uses a bus-master DMA device, or that uses a system DMA controller that does not generate interrupts, must use other means to determine when a DMA transfer completes. For example, this driver might use a timer interrupt to periodically poll the status of the DMA transfer.

A driver can supply a pointer to a *DmaCompletionRoutine* routine as an optional parameter to the [MapTransferEx](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-pmap_transfer_ex) routine.

### Examples

To define a *DmaCompletionRoutine* callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps [Code Analysis for Drivers](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/code-analysis-for-drivers), [Static Driver Verifier](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier) (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a *DmaCompletionRoutine* callback routine that is named `MyDmaCompletionRoutine`, use the DMA_COMPLETION_ROUTINE type as shown in this code example:

```cpp
DMA_COMPLETION_ROUTINE MyDmaCompletionRoutine;
```

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

```cpp
_Use_decl_annotations_
VOID
  MyDmaCompletionRoutine(
    PDMA_ADAPTER DmaAdapter,
    PDEVICE_OBJECT DeviceObject,
    PVOID CompletionContext,
    DMA_COMPLETION_STATUS Status
    )
  {
      // Function body
  }
```

The DMA_COMPLETION_ROUTINE function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the `_Use_decl_annotations_` annotation to your function definition. The `_Use_decl_annotations_` annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the DMA_COMPLETION_ROUTINE function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see [Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/declaring-functions-using-function-role-types-for-wdm-drivers). For information about _Use_decl_annotations\_, see [Annotating Function Behavior](/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-behavior).
