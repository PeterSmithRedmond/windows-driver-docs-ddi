## -description

The **ExAcquireSpinLockExclusive** routine acquires a [spin lock](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks) for exclusive access by the caller, and raises the IRQL to DISPATCH\_LEVEL.

## -parameters

### -param SpinLock

[in, out] A pointer to the spin lock to acquire for exclusive access. The caller must not already own this spin lock.

## -returns

**ExAcquireSpinLockExclusive** returns the previous IRQL value. For more information, see Remarks.

## -remarks

On entry to this routine, the caller must be running at IRQL \<= DISPATCH\_LEVEL. This routine raises the IRQL to DISPATCH\_LEVEL and returns the original (on-entry) IRQL value.

To release the spin lock, call the [**ExReleaseSpinLockExclusive**](nf-wdm-exreleasespinlockexclusive.md) routine. **ExReleaseSpinLockExclusive** restores the IRQL to the original value that it had on entry to **ExAcquireSpinLockExclusive**.

A spin lock is a 32-bit variable of type EX\_SPIN\_LOCK. The driver must allocate the storage for the spin lock and initialize the spin lock to zero. This storage must be located in nonpaged system-space memory.

The caller should hold the spin lock only briefly before releasing it. For more information, see [Introduction to Spin Locks](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks).

> [!NOTE]
> Recursive acquisition of a spin lock causes deadlock and is not allowed.
