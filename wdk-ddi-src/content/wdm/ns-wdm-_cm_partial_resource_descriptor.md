## -remarks

A **CM_PARTIAL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR** structure can describe either a raw (bus-relative) resource or a translated (system physical) resource, depending on the routine or IRP with which it is being used. For more information, see [Raw and Translated Resources](/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/raw-and-translated-resources) and [IRP_MN_START_DEVICE](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-start-device).

There can only be *1* **DeviceSpecificData** block. It must be located at the end of all resource descriptors in a full descriptor block.
