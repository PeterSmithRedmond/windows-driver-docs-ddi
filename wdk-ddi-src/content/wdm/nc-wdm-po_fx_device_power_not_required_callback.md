## -description

The *DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback* callback routine notifies the device driver that the device is not required to stay in the D0 power state.

## -parameters

### -param Context [in]

A pointer to the device context. The device driver uses this context to store information about the current power state of the device. The device driver specified this pointer in the **DeviceContext** member of the [**PO_FX_DEVICE**](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_po_fx_device_v1) structure that the driver used to register the device with the power management framework (PoFx). This context is opaque to PoFx.

## -remarks

When PoFx calls the driver's *DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback* routine, the driver must first decide whether to initiate a transition to a low-power Dx state (by sending an [IRP_MN_SET_POWER](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-set-power) request down the device stack) or to remain in the D0 state. Next, without waiting for any Dx transition to complete, the driver must call the [PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-pofxcompletedevicepowernotrequired) routine to notify PoFx that the driver completed its response to the *DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback* callback. The driver can call **PoFxCompleteDevicePowerNotRequired** before or after the *DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback* routine returns.

When a device is in the D0 state, and the Fx state or active/idle condition of a component in the device changes, PoFx evaluates whether the device can enter a low-power Dx state or must remain in the D0 state. If the device can enter a low-power Dx state, PoFx calls the driver's *DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback* routine.

If the device enters a low-power Dx state in response to a *DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback* callback, but PoFx later determines that the device must enter the D0 state, PoFx calls the driver's [DevicePowerRequiredCallback](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-po_fx_device_power_required_callback) routine. In response to this call, the device must enter the D0 state.

### Examples

To define a *DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback* callback routine, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback routine you're defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps [Code Analysis for Drivers](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/code-analysis-for-drivers), [Static Driver Verifier](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier) (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it's a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

For example, to define a *DevicePowerNotRequiredCallback* callback routine that is named `MyDevicePowerNotRequiredCallback`, use the PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK type as shown in this code example:

```cpp
PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK MyDevicePowerNotRequiredCallback;
```

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

```cpp
_Use_decl_annotations_
VOID
  MyDevicePowerNotRequiredCallback(
    PVOID Context
    )
  {
      // Function body
  }

```

The PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK function type is defined in the Wdm.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the `_Use_decl_annotations_` annotation to your function definition. The `_Use_decl_annotations_` annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the PO_FX_DEVICE_POWER_NOT_REQUIRED_CALLBACK function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see [Declaring Functions by Using Function Role Types for WDM Drivers](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/declaring-functions-using-function-role-types-for-wdm-drivers). For information about `_Use_decl_annotations_`, see [Annotating Function Behavior](/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-behavior).
