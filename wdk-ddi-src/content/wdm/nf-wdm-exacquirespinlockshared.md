## -description

The **ExAcquireSpinLockShared** routine acquires a [spin lock](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks) for shared access by the caller, and raises the IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEL.

## -parameters

### -param SpinLock [in, out]

A pointer to the spin lock to acquire for shared access. The caller must not already own this spin lock.

## -returns

The ExAcquireSpinLockShared routine returns the previous IRQL value. For more information, see the [Remarks](#remarks) section.

## -remarks

On entry to this routine, the caller must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL. This routine raises the IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEL and returns the original (on-entry) IRQL value.

To release the spin lock, call the [**ExReleaseSpinLockShared**](nf-wdm-exreleasespinlockshared.md) routine. **ExReleaseSpinLockShared** restores the IRQL to the original value that it had on entry to **ExAcquireSpinLockShared**.

A spin lock is a 32-bit variable of type EX_SPIN_LOCK. The driver must allocate the storage for the spin lock and initialize the spin lock to zero. This storage must be located in nonpaged system-space memory.

The caller should hold the spin lock only briefly before releasing it. For more information, see [Introduction to Spin Locks](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-spin-locks).

Recursive acquisition of a spin lock causes deadlock and is not allowed.
