# ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite function

## -description

The **ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite** routine releases the input resource of the indicated thread.

## -parameters

### -param Resource [in, out]


A pointer to the resource to release.

### -param ResourceThreadId [in]


Identifies the thread that originally acquired the resource. If this is not the currently executing thread, the caller must have transferred ownership of the resource by calling the [ExSetResourceOwnerPointerEx](nf-wdm-exsetresourceownerpointerex.md) routine first on the thread that originally acquired the resource.

## -remarks

If this is not the currently executing thread, the caller must have transferred ownership of the resource by calling the [ExSetResourceOwnerPointerEx](nf-wdm-exsetresourceownerpointerex.md) routine first on the thread that originally acquired the resource. This is to ensure that thread A does not get terminated or deleted before thread B has a chance to release the resource.

Unless the caller is running in a system thread, the caller must explicitly disable the delivery of normal kernel APCs before calling this routine. This requirement prevents threads from being suspended while they manipulate or hold a resource. The caller can disable normal kernel APC delivery by calling the [KeEnterCriticalRegion](../ntddk/nf-ntddk-keentercriticalregion.md) routine. Delivery must remain disabled until the resource is released, at which point it can be reenabled by calling the [KeLeaveCriticalRegion](../ntddk/nf-ntddk-keleavecriticalregion.md) routine. For more information, see [Disabling APCs](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/disabling-apcs).

This requirement does not apply to calls made to **ExReleaseResourceForThreadLite** from a system thread. A caller running in a system thread does not need to explicitly disable APCs before calling this routine.
