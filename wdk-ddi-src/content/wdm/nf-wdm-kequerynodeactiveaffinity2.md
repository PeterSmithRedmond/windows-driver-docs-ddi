## -description

This routine returns the current multi-group processor affinity of the given NUMA node.

## -parameters

### -param NodeNumber [in]

Supplies the node number of the node to query.

### -param GroupAffinities [out]

Supplies a pointer to an array of [GROUP_AFFINITY](/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/miniport/ns-miniport-_group_affinity) structures that upon success receive a group number and the affinity mask of the identified group.

### -param GroupAffinitiesCount [in]

A value of type USHORT that specifies the number of elements in the group affinities array. If the array is too small to hold the node affinity then **STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL** is returned and the number of elements required is returned in *GroupAffinitiesRequired*.

### -param GroupAffinitiesRequired [out]

A pointer to a value of type USHORT that receives the number of group affinities required to represent the node affinity. In the case of a memory-only NUMA node, zero is returned.

## -returns

**STATUS_SUCCESS** if the node affinity was queried successfully.

**STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER** if an invalid node number was specified.

**STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL** if the supplied array is too small.

## -remarks

Starting in Windows Server 2022, the operating system no longer splits large NUMA nodes; instead, Windows reports the true NUMA topology of the system. When a node contains more than 64 processors, a NUMA node spans across more than a single group. In this case, the system assigns a primary group for each NUMA node. The primary group is always the one containing the most processors. To determine the number of active processors in a given NUMA node (across all groups), call [**KeQueryNodeActiveProcessorCount**](./nf-wdm-kequerynodeactiveprocessorcount.md). For more info about this change in behavior, see [NUMA Support](/windows/win32/procthread/numa-support).

To re-enable the legacy node splitting behavior, make the following change to the registry and reboot the system:

`reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NUMA" /v SplitLargeNodes /t REG_DWORD /d 1`

If your driver maps processors to NUMA nodes by calling [**KeQueryNodeActiveAffinity**](./nf-wdm-kequerynodeactiveaffinity.md), and your code runs on systems with more than 64 processors per NUMA node, use one of the following workarounds:

1. Migrate to the multi-group node affinity APIs (user-mode and kernel-mode), such as **KeQueryNodeActiveAffinity2**.

1. Call [**KeQueryLogicalProcessorRelationship**](./nf-wdm-kequerylogicalprocessorrelationship.md) with **RelationNumaNode** to directly query the NUMA node associated with a given processor number.

The following example shows code that would be problematic on Windows Server 2022 and later, and then shows both workarounds.
