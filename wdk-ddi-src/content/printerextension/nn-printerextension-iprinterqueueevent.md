## -description

Provides the event delegate for printer queue events.

## -remarks

An event sink that implements **IPrinterQueueEvent** and the event source, [IPrinterQueue](./nn-printerextension-iprinterqueue.md) are connected via the [IConnectionPoint](/windows/win32/api/ocidl/nn-ocidl-iconnectionpoint) mechanism. You must retrieve a pointer to the **IConnectionPoint** interface by invoking **QueryInterface** on the **IPrinterQueue** object.

> [!NOTE]
> It is mandatory to implement **IDispatch::Invoke** on the event sink that implements **IPrinterQueueEvent**, since that is the mechanism via which events are raised. It is sufficient to provide stub implementations of the other methods on the **IDispatch** interface.
