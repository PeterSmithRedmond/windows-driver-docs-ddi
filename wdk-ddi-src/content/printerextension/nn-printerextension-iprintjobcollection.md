## -description

This interfaces provides an enumeration of the jobs in the print queue.

The enumerated list of jobs represents a snapshot of the current job status.

## -inheritance

The **IPrintJobCollection** interface inherits from the [IUnknown](/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown) interface. **IPrintJobCollection** also has these types of members:

## -remarks

The order of print jobs in the enumerated list is the same as the order provided by [EnumJobs](/windows/win32/printdocs/enumjobs), which is the actual print queue order.

**IPrintJobCollection** also helps to make it possible to perform job management from a UWP device app or from a printer extension. For more information, see [Job Management](/windows-hardware/drivers/print/job-management).
