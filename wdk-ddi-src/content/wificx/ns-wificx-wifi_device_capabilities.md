## -description

The **WIFI_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES** structure describes a WiFiCx device's capabilities.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

The sum (in bytes) of the sizes of all contained elements.

### -field HardwareRadioState

Specifies whether the radio is enabled by hardware. Valid values are 0 (disabled) and 1 (enabled).

### -field SoftwareRadioState

Specifies whether they radio is enabled by software. Valid values are 0 (disabled) and 1 (enabled).

### -field FirmwareVersion[MAX_FIRMWARE_VERSION_LENGTH]

The firmware version.

### -field ActionFramesSupported

Specifies whether sending and receiving action frames is supported. Valid values are 0 (not supported) and 1 (supported).

### -field NumRxStreams

The supported number of RX spatial streams.

### -field NumTxStreams

The supported number of TX spatial streams.

### -field Support_eCSA

Specifies whether eCSA is supported. Valid values are 0 (not supported) and 1 (supported).

### -field MACAddressRandomization

Specifies whether the adapter supports MAC address randomization. Valid values are 0 (not supported) and 1 (supported).

### -field MACAddressRandomizationMask

A bit mask that specifies for each address bit whether it can be randomized (0) or should keep the same value as the permanent address (1). The default is all zeros.

### -field BluetoothCoexistenceSupport

A [**WDI_BLUETOOTH_COEXISTENCE_SUPPORT**](../dot11wificxtypes/ne-dot11wificxtypes-wdi_bluetooth_coexistence_support.md) enum that defines the supported level of Wi-Fi - Bluetooth coexistence.

### -field SupportsNonWdiOidRequests

Specifies non-WDI OID support. Valid values are:
- 0 : Not supported. OIDs that the Microsoft component does not understand are not forwarded to the adapter.
- 1 : Supported. OIDs that the Microsoft component does not understand are forwarded to the adapter.

### -field FastTransitionSupported

Specifies whether the Fast Transition is supported. Valid values are 0 (not supported) and 1 (supported).

### -field MU_MIMOSupported

Specifies whether Mu-MIMO is supported. Valid values are 0 (not supported) and 1 (supported).

### -field BSSTransitionSupported

Specifies if 802.11v BSS transition is supported. Valid values are 0 (not supported) and 1 (supported).

### -field SAEAuthenticationSupported

Specifies if the device supports SAE authentication. Valid values are 0 (not supported) and 1 (supported).

### -field MBOSupported

Specifies if the device supports Multiband Operation (MBO). Valid values are 0 (not supported) and 1 (supported).

### -field BeaconReportsImplemented

Specifies if the adapter implements beacon report measurements. Valid values are 0 (the adapter does not implement beacon report measurements) and 1 (the adapter implements its own 11k beacon report).

### -field NumRadios

The number of radios. **NumRadios** is equal to the number of connections on different channels that the device can simultaneously Rx and Tx.

## -remarks

Call [**WIFI_DEVICE_CAPABILITIES_INIT**](nf-wificx-wifi_device_capabilities_init.md) to initialize this structure and fill in its **Size** field. Then call [**WifiDeviceSetDeviceCapabilities**](nf-wificx-wifidevicesetdevicecapabilities.md) to report device capabilities to WiFiCx.
