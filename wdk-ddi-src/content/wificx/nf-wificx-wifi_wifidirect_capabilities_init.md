## -description

The **WIFI_WIFIDIRECT_CAPABILITIES_INIT** function initializes a [**WIFI_WIFIDIRECT_CAPABILITIES**](ns-wificx-wifi_wifidirect_capabilities.md) structure.

## -parameters

### -param Capabilities

[_Out_] A pointer to a client driver-allocated **WIFI_WIFIDIRECT_CAPABILITIES** structure.

## -remarks

This function zeroes out the memory of the **WIFI_WIFIDIRECT_CAPABILITIES** structure, then fills in the **Size** member. Client drivers must then call [**WifiDeviceSetWifiDirectCapabilities**](nf-wificx-wifidevicesetwifidirectcapabilities.md) to report WiFi Direct capabilities to WiFiCx.
