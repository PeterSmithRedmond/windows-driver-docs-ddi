## -description

The **CcSetFileSizesEx** routine updates the cache maps and section object for a cached file whose size has changed.

## -parameters

### -param FileObject

[in] Pointer to a file object for the cached file.

### -param FileSizes

[in] Pointer to a [**CC_FILE_SIZES**](ns-ntifs-cc_file_sizes.md) structure containing the new file size information.

## -returns

**CcSetFileSizesEx** returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the file size was successfully changed, and, if a purge was needed that the purge was successful. Otherwise it returns a non-success NSTATUS code such as STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES.

## -remarks

File systems must call **CcSetFileSizesEx** to update the cache manager data structures whenever one of the following changes is made to a cached file:

* Its allocation size is increased.

* Its valid data length is decreased.

* Its valid data length is increased by a non-cached I/O operation.

* Its file size is increased or decreased.

If any failure occurs, **CcSetFileSizesEx** raises a status exception for that particular failure. For example, if a pool allocation failure occurs, **CcSetFileSizesEx** raises a STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES exception. Therefore, to gain control if a failure occurs, the driver should wrap the call to **CcSetFileSizesEx** in a *try-except* or *try-finally* statement.

To cache a file, use [**CcInitializeCacheMap**](nf-ntifs-ccinitializecachemap.md).

To get the size of the cached file, pass **FileObject** to [**CcGetFileSizePointer**](nf-ntifs-ccgetfilesizepointer.md).
