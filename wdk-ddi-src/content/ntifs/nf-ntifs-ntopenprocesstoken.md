## -description

The **NtOpenProcessToken** routine opens the access token associated with a process, and returns a handle that can be used to access that token.

## -parameters

### -param ProcessHandle [in]

Handle to the process whose access token is to be opened. The handle must have PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION access. Use the **NtCurrentProcess** macro, defined in *Ntddk.h*, to specify the current process.

### -param DesiredAccess [in]

[**ACCESS_MASK**](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/access-mask) structure specifying the requested types of access to the access token. These requested access types are compared with the token's discretionary access-control list ([**DACL**](../wdm/ns-wdm-_acl.md)) to determine which accesses are granted or denied.

### -param TokenHandle [out]

Pointer to a caller-allocated variable that receives a handle to the newly opened access token.

## -returns

**NtOpenProcessToken** returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error status. Possible error status codes include the following:

| Return code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED          | *ProcessHandle* did not have PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION access. |
| STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES | A new token handle could not be allocated. |
| STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE         | *ProcessHandle* was not a valid handle. |
| STATUS_OBJECT_TYPE_MISMATCH   | *ProcessHandle* was not a process handle. |
| STATUS_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD     | The caller does not have the privilege ([SeSecurityPrivilege](/windows/win32/secauthz/privilege-constants)) necessary to create a token handle with the access specified in the *DesiredAccess* parameter. |
| STATUS_QUOTA_EXCEEDED         | The process's memory quota is not sufficient to allocate the token handle. |
| STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL           | The token handle could not be created. |

## -remarks

To specify attributes for the access token handle, use [**NtOpenProcessTokenEx**](nf-ntifs-ntopenprocesstokenex.md) instead.

The handle can be accessed by the process in whose context the driver is running.

Any handle obtained by calling **NtOpenProcessToken** must eventually be released by calling [**NtClose**](nf-ntifs-ntclose.md).

For more information about security and access control, see [Windows security model for driver developers](/windows-hardware/drivers/driversecurity/windows-security-model) and the documentation on these topics in the Windows SDK.

For calls from kernel-mode drivers, the **Nt*Xxx*** and **Zw*Xxx*** versions of a Windows Native System Services routine can behave differently in the way that they handle and interpret input parameters. For more information about the relationship between the **Nt*Xxx*** and **Zw*Xxx*** versions of a routine, see [Using Nt and Zw Versions of the Native System Services Routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-nt-and-zw-versions-of-the-native-system-services-routines).
