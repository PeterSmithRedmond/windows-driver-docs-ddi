## -description

PosCxPutPendingEventMemory tries to delegate a memory object containing the event data to a waiting caller. If the target caller does not have a read request waiting, the new event is added to      the designated event queue (control or data).

## -parameters

### -param device [in]

A handle to a framework device object that represents the device.

### -param deviceInterfaceTag [in]

The device interface associated with the event.  By default, only file objects that have the same tag will receive this event.

### -param eventMemory [in]

The new event data memory object that contains both the point-of-service event header and the data. PosCx will take over ownership of this passed in memory object.

### -param eventAttr [in]

The event attributes.

## -returns

Possible return values are:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| **STATUS_SUCCESS** | The event was created and delegated to a waiting caller, or the event was discarded because there is no device owner. |
| **STATUS_PENDING** | The event was queued because no caller is currently waiting. |
| **STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY** | The PosCx library was not successfully initialized. |
| Other errors | Other appropriate failure error codes. |
