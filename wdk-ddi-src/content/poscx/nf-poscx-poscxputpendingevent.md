## -description

PosCxPutPendingEvent creates a new event object, copies the event data to the new event object, and tries to delegate it to the waiting caller. If the target caller does not have a read request waiting, the new event is added to the designated event queue (control or data).

## -parameters

### -param device [in]

A handle to a framework device object that represents the device.

### -param deviceInterfaceTag [in]

The device interface associated with the event.  By default, only file objects that have the same tag will receive this event.

### -param eventType [in]

The new event type.

### -param rawEventDataSize [in]

The raw event (without point-of-service header) buffer size in bytes.

### -param rawEventDataPtr

The pointer to the raw (without point-of-service header) event data. The caller may reuse/release *rawEventDataPtr* after **PosCxPutPendingEvent** returns.

### -param eventAttr [in]

The event attributes.

## -returns

Possible return values are:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| **STATUS_SUCCESS** | The event was created and delegated to a waiting caller, or the event was discarded because there is no device owner. |
| **STATUS_PENDING** | The event was queued because no caller is currently waiting. |
| Other errors | Other appropriate failure error codes. |
