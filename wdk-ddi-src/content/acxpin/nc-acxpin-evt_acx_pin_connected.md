## -description

The **EVT_ACX_PIN_CONNECTED** callback function is implemented by the driver and is called when the circuit bridge pin is connected to bridge pin of another circuit.

## -parameters

### -param Pin

An [ACXPIN](index.md) object representing the specific pin that was connected.

### -param TargetCircuit

An **ACXTARGETCIRCUIT** object representing the circuit to which the *Pin* was connected.

### -param TargetPinId

The identifier of the pin in the *TargetCircuit* to which the *Pin* was connected.

## -remarks

This event happens when the composite circuit is fully initialized. From this point on, the *TargetCircuit* can be used to send [kernel streaming properties](/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/ks-properties) and [kernel streaming methods](/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/ks-methods) requests.
