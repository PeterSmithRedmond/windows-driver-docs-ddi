## -description

The **D3D12DDI_NODE_CPU_INPUT_0108** structure describes the input data for a single node within a work graph where the input is provided by the CPU.

## -struct-fields

### -field EntrypointIndex

The index of a given entry to a work graph.

### -field NumRecords

The number of records to add. **NumRecords** is always used; that is, even with empty records the count of empty work items still drives node invocations.

### -field pRecords

Pointer to the record definitions, laid out with the same member packing and struct size rules that C uses. The driver should copy/save this data during command list recording.

### -field RecordStrideInBytes

Distance between the start of each record, in bytes. This value must be aligned to the largest scalar member size and be a multiple of 4 bytes.

## -remarks

For more information, see [Work graphs](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/work-graphs).
