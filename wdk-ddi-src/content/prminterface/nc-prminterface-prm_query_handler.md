## -description

This routine queries for the presence of a specific PRM handler.

## -parameters

### -param HandlerGuid [in]

Supplies the GUID of the PRM handler to query.

### -param Found [out]

Returns result from the query.

## -returns

This method returns NTSTATUS which contains STATUS_SUCCESS if the call was successful. Otherwise, the method returns an appropriate error code.

## -remarks

PRM_QUERY_HANDLER is not a system routine that can be called directly by name. This routine is callable only by pointer from the address returned in a [PRM_INTERFACE](./ns-prminterface-prm_interface.md) structure. Drivers obtain the address of this routine by calling [**ExGetPrmInterface**](./nf-prminterface-exgetprminterface.md).
