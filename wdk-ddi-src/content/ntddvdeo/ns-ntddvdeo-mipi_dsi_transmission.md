# MIPI_DSI_TRANSMISSION structure

## -description

The **MIPI_DSI_TRANSMISSION** structure is used to describe a MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) DSI (Display Serial Interface) transmission request that contains one or more DSI packets to be sent to the display device.

## -struct-fields

### -field TotalBufferSize

[in] The total size of the buffer that contains the transmission request, in bytes.

### -field PacketCount

[in] The number of packets in the transmission request.

### -field FailedPacket

[out] Index of the first failed packet in the transmission, if any failures occur.

### -field TransmissionMode

[in] Transmission mode.

### -field ReportMipiErrors

[in] When set, indicates that MIPI protocol errors should be reported.

### -field ClearMipiErrors

[in] When set, indicates that MIPI protocol errors should be cleared after being reported.

### -field SecondaryPort

[in] Indicates whether the transmission is for a secondary port.

### -field ManufacturingMode

[in] Indicates whether the transmission is happening in a special manufacturing mode.

### -field Reserved

Reserved.

### -field ReadWordCount

[out] Number of words read during a read operation.

### -field FinalCommandExtraPayload

[in] Size of any extra payload that should be sent with the final command.

### -field MipiErrors

[out] Errors reported by the MIPI DSI hardware, if any.

### -field HostErrors

[out] Errors reported by the host processor or controller that is managing the transmission, if any.

### -field Packets

Array of **PacketCount** [**MIPI_DSI_PACKET**](ntddvdeo-mipi_dsi_packet.md) structures that describe the packets to be transmitted/modified.
