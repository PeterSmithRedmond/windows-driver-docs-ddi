## -remarks

The **[STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY](ns-ntddstor-_storage_property_query.md)** structure is passed as input to an **[IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY](ni-ntddstor-ioctl_storage_query_property.md)** request to retrieve the properties of a storage device or adapter.

The optional output buffer returned from an **IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY** control code request can be one of several structures, depending on the value of the **PropertyId** member of the **[STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY](ns-ntddstor-_storage_property_query.md)** structure. If the **QueryType** member of the **STORAGE_PROPERTY_QUERY** is set to **PropertyExistsQuery**, then no structure is returned.
