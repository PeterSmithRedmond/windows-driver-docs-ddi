# PFND3DKMT_CHECKEXCLUSIVEOWNERSHIP callback function

## -description

The **D3DKMTCheckExclusiveOwnership** function checks whether any kernel device object in the operating system has an exclusive level of ownership of any video present sources.

## -parameters

### -param unnamedParam1

## -returns

**D3DKMTCheckExclusiveOwnership** returns a Boolean value that indicates **TRUE** if any kernel device object in the operating system has an exclusive level of ownership of any video present sources and **FALSE** otherwise.

## -remarks

For a description of ownership levels of video present sources, see the [D3DKMTSetVidPnSourceOwnerfunction](nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtsetvidpnsourceowner.md) and the [D3DKMT_SETVIDPNSOURCEOWNER](ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_setvidpnsourceowner.md) structure. An exclusive level of ownership is represented by the *D3DKMT_VIDPNSOURCEOWNER_EXCLUSIVE* or *D3DKMT_VIDPNSOURCEOWNER_EXCLUSIVEGDI* owner type, which can be specified in one of the elements in the array that the *pType* member of **D3DKMT_SETVIDPNSOURCEOWNER** specifies.
