# PFND3DKMT_OPENKEYEDMUTEXFROMNTHANDLE callback function

## -description

Implemented by the client driver to open a keyed mutex from an NT handle to the process.

## -syntax

```cpp
PFND3DKMT_OPENKEYEDMUTEXFROMNTHANDLE PfnD3dkmtOpenKeyedMutexFromNtHandle;

NTSTATUS PfnD3dkmtOpenKeyedMutexFromNtHandle(
    D3DKMT_OPENKEYEDMUTEXFROMNTHANDLE *unnamedParam1
)
{...}
```

## -parameters

### -param unnamedParam1

Pointer to a [D3DKMT_OPENKEYEDMUTEXFROMNTHANDLE](ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_openkeyedmutexfromnthandle.md) structure that contains information to open a keyed mutex from NT handle.

## -returns

The method returns **STATUS_SUCCESS** if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method might return an appropriate **[NTSTATUS](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values)** error code.

## -remarks

Register your implementation of this callback function by setting the appropriate member of [D3DKMT_OPENKEYEDMUTEXFROMNTHANDLE](ns-d3dkmthk-_d3dkmt_openkeyedmutexfromnthandle.md) and then calling **PfnD3dkmtOpenKeyedMutexFromNtHandle**.
