## -description

**D3DKMTNotifyWorkSubmission** notifies the kernel-mode display driver that the user-mode display driver has submitted work to the GPU.

## -parameters

### -param unnamedParam1

Pointer to a [**D3DKMT_NOTIFY_WORK_SUBMISSION**](ns-d3dkmthk-d3dkmt_notify_work_submission.md) structure that identifies the hardware queue on which the work was submitted.

## -returns

**D3DKMTNotifyWorkSubmission** returns STATUS_SUCCESS if it succeeds in pinging KMD. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate error code such as STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER if an invalid hardware queue or flag are specified.

## -remarks

KMD can specify the doorbell connection status as D3DDDI_DOORBELL_STATUS_CONNECTED_NOTIFY at [doorbell creation time](../d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createdoorbell.md). Whenever UMD sees this doorbell status, it adjusts its work submission workflow such that after writing a new command and ringing the doorbell, it calls into the kernel using **D3DKMTNotifyWorkSubmission**. *Dxgkrnl* forwards this call to KMD using [**DxgkDdiNotifyWorkSubmission**](../d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_notifyworksubmission.md).

KMD can also request notification dynamically after doorbell creation. If KMD detects a condition where it should be notified of work submission on this hardware queue, then it can first disconnect the doorbell by calling *Dxgkrnl*'s [**DxgkCbDisconnectDoorbell**](../d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_disconnectdoorbell.md) with status D3DDDI_DOORBELL_STATUS_DISCONNECTED_RETRY. Later, when UMD tries to reconnect the doorbell, KMD can make the connection with status D3DDDI_DOORBELL_STATUS_CONNECTED_NOTIFY.

See [**DxgkDdiNotifyWorkSubmission**](../d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_notifyworksubmission.md) for details on how and when KMD should use this functionality.
