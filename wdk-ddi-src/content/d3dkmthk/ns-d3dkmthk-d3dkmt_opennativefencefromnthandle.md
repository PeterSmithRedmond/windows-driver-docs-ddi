## -description

The **D3DKMT_OPENNATIVEFENCEFROMNTHANDLE** structure is a parameter for the [**D3DKMTOpenNativeFenceFromNTHandle**](nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtopennativefencefromnthandle.md) function. It describes the native fence to open.

## -struct-fields

### -field hNtHandle

[in] NT handle for the shared fence object.

### -field hDevice

[in] Device handle to open this fence object on.

### -field EngineAffinity

[in] Defines the physical adapters where the GPU virtual address is mapped.

### -field Flags

[in] A [**D3DDDI_SYNCHRONIZATIONOBJECT_FLAGS**](../d3dukmdt/ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddi_synchronizationobject_flags.md) structure that identifies the attributes of the synchronization object.

### -field hSyncObject

[out] Handle to the opened fence object.

### -field NativeFenceMapping

[out] A [**D3DDDI_NATIVEFENCEMAPPING**](../d3dukmdt/ns-d3dukmdt-d3dddi_nativefencemapping.md) structure that contains process mapping information for the fence object.

### -field Reserved[32]

Reserved for system use.
