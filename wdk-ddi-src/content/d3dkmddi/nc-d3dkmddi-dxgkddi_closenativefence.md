## -description

**DxgkDdiCloseNativeFence** is called by the OS to close a native GPU fence object.

## -parameters

### -param hAdapter

[in] A handle to a context block associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver previously provided this handle to *Dxgkrnl* in the **MiniportDeviceContext** output parameter of the [**DXGKDDI_ADD_DEVICE**](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md) function.

### -param pCloseNativeFence

[in/out] Pointer to a [**DXGKARG_CLOSENATIVEFENCE**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkarg_closenativefence.md) structure that describes the native GPU fence to open.

## -returns

**DxgkDdiCloseNativeFence** returns STATUS_SUCCESS if KMD was able to successfully open a native GPU fence object. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.

## -remarks

For more information about native GPU fences, see [Native GPU fence objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects).
