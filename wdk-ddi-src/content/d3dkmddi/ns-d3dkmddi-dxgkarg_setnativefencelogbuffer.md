## -description

**DXGKARG_SETNATIVEFENCELOGBUFFER** is the input structure for [**DxgkDdiSetNativeFenceLogBuffer**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_setnativefencelogbuffer.md).

## -struct-fields

### -field hHwQueue

[in] Driver handle of the HWQueue to which this log belongs.

### -field NumberOfEntries

[in] Number of entries in the array of log entries that **LogBufferCpuVa** points to.

### -field LogBufferCpuVa

[in] The read/write kernel-mode CPU virtual address of the [native fence log buffer](../d3dukmdt/ns-d3dukmdt-dxgk_native_fence_log_buffer.md).

### -field LogBufferGpuVa

[in] The read/write GPU VA of the log buffer in user process address space.

### -field LogBufferSystemProcessGpuVa

[in] The read/write GPU VA of the log buffer in system address space.

### -field Flags

[in] A [**DXGKARG_SETNATIVEFENCELOGBUFFER_FLAGS**](../d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkarg_setnativefencelogbuffer_flags.md) structure that contains flags for writing a payload into the native fence log buffer.

### -field Reserved[32]

Reserved for system use.
