## -description

The OS calls **DxgkDdiUpdateCurrentValuesFromCpu** to update the **CurrentValue** of a batch of native fences from the CPU.

## -parameters

### -param pUpdateCurrentValuesFromCpu

[in] Pointer to a [**DXGKARG_UPDATECURRENTVALUESFROMCPU**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkarg_updatecurrentvaluesfromcpu.md) structure that contains the current values to update.

## -returns

## -remarks

 This DDI is used to support the existing "signal fence from CPU" API semantics. Instead of *Dxgkrnl* writing a new **CurrentValue**, the driver is asked to write to **CurrentValue** in order to give drivers an opportunity to insert any required pre-write synchronization/barriers. The OS synchronizes CPU-side updates and guarantees that the most up to date value is available to **DxgkDdiUpdateCurrentValuesFromCpu**. After updating **CurrentValue**, the driver must trigger the GPU to unblock hardware queues that were waiting on this fence and got unblocked with the update to **CurrentValue**.

In a nutshell the steps to be followed by the driver are:

``` pseudocode

for i = 1 : NumFences
  1. Insert pre-write memory barrier if required
  2. write new value to CurrentValueCpuVa
  3. trigger GPU to unblock any HwQueues that got unblocked by the updated CurrentValue
end
```

The OS only guarantees that the **CurrentValueKernelCpuVa** pointer is valid for the duration of this DDI call, and not before or after it. Hence, KMD must never cache this pointer for use elsewhere.
