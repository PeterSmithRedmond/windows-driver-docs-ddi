## -description

The **DXGKARGCB_FEATURE_NATIVEFENCE_CAPS_1** structure describes the native fence capabilities of the OS.

## -struct-fields

### -field SupportOptimizedDefaultFenceType

Indicates whether the OS supports **D3DDDI_NATIVEFENCE_TYPE_DEFAULT** as described in [Native GPU fence objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects). If the OS sets this as TRUE, the OS supports allocating native fence storage in VRAM. KMD should query this OS cap and determine whether the OS allows KMD to specify a local memory **SupportedSegmentSet** during the creation of fence type **D3DDDI_NATIVEFENCE_TYPE_DEFAULT**.

### -field SupportIntraGpuFenceType

Indicates whether the OS supports **D3DDDI_NATIVEFENCE_TYPE_INTRA_GPU** as described in [Native GPU fence objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects).

## -remarks

For a sample code snippet and more information about native GPU fences, see [Native GPU fence objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects).
