## -description

**DXGKARG_DESTROYNATIVEFENCE** is the structure passed to [**DxgkDdiDestroyNativeFence**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_destroynativefence.md).

## -struct-fields

### -field hGlobalNativeFence

[in] Handle to the global native GPU fence object. KMD returned this handle from a prior call to [**DXGKARG_CREATENATIVEFENCE**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkarg_createnativefence.md).

### -field Flags

[in] A [**DXGKARG_DESTROYNATIVEFENCE_FLAGS**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkarg_destroynativefence_flags.md) structure containing flags to use when destroying the native GPU fence object.

### -field Reserved[32]

Reserved for system use.

## -remarks

KMD should destroy its global fence data associated with **hGlobalNativeFence**.

For more information about native GPU fences, see [Native GPU fence objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects).
