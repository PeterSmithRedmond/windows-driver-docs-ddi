## -description

The **DxgkDdiDestroyDoorbell** function destroys a previously created doorbell object.

## -parameters

### -param pArgs

[in/out] Pointer to a [**DXGKARG_DESTROYDOORBELL**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkarg_destroydoorbell.md) structure that describes the doorbell to destroy.

## -returns

**DxgkDdiDestroyDoorbell** must succeed and return STATUS_SUCCESS.

## -remarks

The OS calls KMD's **DxgkDdiDestroyDoorbell** when UMD calls [**D3DKMTDestroyDoorbell**](../d3dkmthk/nf-d3dkmthk-d3dkmtdestroydoorbell.md).

KMD should disconnect the physical doorbell location and destroy its doorbell objects.

UMD must not use the handle after calling **D3DKMTDestroyDoorbell**.

For more information, see [User-mode work submission](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/user-mode-work-submission).
