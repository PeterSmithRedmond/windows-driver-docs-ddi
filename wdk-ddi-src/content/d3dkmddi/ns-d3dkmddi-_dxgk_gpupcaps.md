# DXGK_GPUPCAPS structure

## -description

A kernel-mode display driver uses the **DXGK_GPUPCAPS** structure to identify its GPU capabilities.


## -struct-fields

### -field Caps

### -field Caps.VirtualMachineHibernation

The driver sets the cap if guest hibernation is supported for GPU-P devices. The support for guest hibernation is optional and not required for driver certification. A VM, which has hibernation enabled and a GPU-P adapter added, will fail to start, if the driver does not support guest hibernation.

### -field Caps.HotDriverUpdate

The driver sets the cap if hot driver update is supported for GPU-P devices.

### -field Caps.Reserved

Reserved.

### -field Caps.Value

The UINT collection of bitfields for the different GPU-P capabilities.

## -remarks

The KMD must fill out these caps in response to a **DXGKQAITYPE_GPUPCAPS** [**QueryAdapterInfo**](ne-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_queryadapterinfotype.md) request. These are queried by the OS during device initialization after [**DxgkDdiStartDevice**](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device.md) is called and only if the adapter supports GPU partitioning.
