# DXGK_HARDWARERESERVEDRANGES structure

## -description

The **DXGK_HARDWARERESERVEDRANGES** structure is used to store the hardware reserved memory ranges that were queried by the call the [**DXGKDDI_QUERYADAPTERINFO**](./nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md).

## -struct-fields

### -field NumRanges

The number of ranges that are reserved.

### -field pPhysicalRanges

Pointer to a [**DXGK_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_RANGE**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_physical_memory_range.md) structure that contains information about the physical memory ranges.

## -remarks

The VidMm (Video Memory Manager) validates whether the ranges returned from [**DXGKDDI_QUERYADAPTERINFO**](./nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md) overlap any regions of memory used by the NTOS (Windows NT-based operating system) memory manager. This validation ensures that the driver does not accidentally report a region of physical memory that is outside the reserved range, as this would violate the security guarantees of the feature.
