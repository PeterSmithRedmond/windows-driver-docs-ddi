## -description

**DXGKARG_OPENNATIVEFENCE** is the structure passed to [**DxgkDdiOpenNativeFence**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_opennativefence.md).

## -struct-fields

### -field hGlobalNativeFence

[in] Driver-assigned handle to the fence object created in the prior call to [**DxgkDdiCreateNativeFence**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createnativefence.md).

### -field hLocalNativeFence

[in/out] On input, the value of **hLocalNativeFence** is the *Dxgkrnl*-generated handle of the object.

On output, the value returned by the KMD is the internal, KMD-maintained handle to be used by subsequent callbacks to refer to this local fence object.

### -field hDevice

[in] Driver handle for the parent device of this local fence object.

### -field CurrentValueGpuVa

[in] Read/write mapping of the current value for the GPU in user process address space.

### -field MonitoredValueGpuVa

[in] Read/write mapping of the monitored value for the GPU in user process address space.

### -field Flags

[in] A [**DXGK_OPENNATIVEFENCE_FLAGS**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgk_opennativefence_flags.md) structure containing flags that indicate how to open the local GPU fence object.

### -field Reserved[32]

Reserved for system use.

## -remarks
