## -description

The **DXGKCBINT_FEATURE_NATIVEFENCE_1** structure is an internal driver structure used by KMD to query the OS for its support of native GPU fence features.

## -struct-fields

### -field GetOSCaps

[in/out] The OS's [**DXGKCB_FEATURE_NATIVEFENCE_CAPS_1**](nc-d3dkmddi-_dxgkargcb_feature_nativefence_caps_1.md) callback function from which the OS returns its support for native GPU fence features.

## -remarks

KMD queries the OS's native GPU fence features by calling the callback function that **GetOSCaps** points to. KMD should maintain an internal cache for the state and version of the results returned.

For a sample code snippet and more information about native GPU fences, see [Native GPU fence objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects).
