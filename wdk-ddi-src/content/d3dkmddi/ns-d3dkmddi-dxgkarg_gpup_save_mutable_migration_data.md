## -description

The **DXGKARG_GPUP_SAVE_MUTABLE_MIGRATION_DATA** structure is used in a call to [**DxgkDdiSaveMutableMigrationData**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_savemutablemigrationdata.md) to save mutable data for a live migration that is about to end.

## -struct-fields

### -field vfIndex

[in] Identifies the virtual function / vDEV being referenced. This index value localizes to the specific virtual device.

### -field DataSize

[in/out] The size, in bytes, of the data buffer that **Data** points to. On the first call to[**DxgkDdiSaveMutableMigrationData**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_savemutablemigrationdata.md), the input value is 0 to indicate that the driver should return the required size of the buffer.

### -field Data

[in/out] A pointer to a buffer that contains the mutable data to be saved. On the first call to [**DxgkDdiSaveMutableMigrationData**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_savemutablemigrationdata.md), this pointer is NULL to indicate that the driver should return the required size of the buffer in **DataSize**.

## -remarks

For more information, see [Live migration on GPU-P devices](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/live-migration-on-gpup-devices).
