## -description

The OS calls KMD's **DxgkDdiDestroyNativeFence** to destroy a tracking object for a native GPU fence.

## -parameters

### -param pDestroyNativeFence

[in/out] Pointer to a [**DXGKARG_DESTROYNATIVEFENCE**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkarg_destroynativefence.md) structure that describes the native GPU fence object to destroy.

## -returns

**DxgkDdiDestroyNativeFence** returns STATUS_SUCCESS if KMD was able to successfully destroy the native GPU fence object. Otherwise, it returns an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.

## -remarks

The OS calls **DxgkDdiDestroyNativeFence** to instruct the KMD to destroy the driver tracking object for a given native GPU fence. After the call returns, the OS will deallocate storage for **CurrentValue** and **MonitoredValue**.

For more information about native GPU fences, see [Native GPU fence objects](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/native-gpu-fence-objects).
